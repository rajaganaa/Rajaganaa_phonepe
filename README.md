# PhonePe Pulse Data Visualization

This project visualizes PhonePe Pulse data using Streamlit and Plotly.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code (`app.py`).
- `data/`: Contains the datasets (currently empty).
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.

## How to Run

1.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    streamlit run src/app.py
    ```

## Note

The application requires a MySQL database and specific data files in the `data/` directory to function correctly.
